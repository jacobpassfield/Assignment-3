\section{Introduction}

A quick Google search defines a fishery to be the industry of rearing and harvesting fish, and other aquatic life. With fish accounting for approximately seventeen percent of global protein consumption, it is no surprise that fisheries contribute one hundred billion dollars to the global economy, supporting roughly 260 million jobs worldwide. Thus fisheries serve as a significant ground for economic growth and development in many countries. 

Beyond economic advantages however, the pressing issues of climate change make analysis in fisheries science paramount in predicting the future of marine populations and, by doing so, protecting an important food source. And with this is mind I began exploring possible areas to focus my project on, starting with how global warming effects marine ecosystems.

\section{The effects of global warming on marine ecosystems}

To begin with an ecosystem is the combination of living organisms and their environment in which energy flows through a biological network, or namely, a food web. An ecosystem can vary in size as long as it is comprised of the following four parts: non-living things, like rocks or soil; producers, living organisms that can make their own food, like seaweed or flowers; consumers, living organisms that either eat producers or other bling organisms, like fish or humans; and pathogens that survive on decaying matter, like bacteria or fungus. Therefore a marine ecosystem relates to aquatic biological networks. These networks are more complex and the organic resources more evolved, when compared to other ecosystems. This leads to ocean organisms being more sensitive to changes in the environment, so in turn, they are effected by global warming. 

Numerous articles cite that rising temperatures due to warming affect fish body size, with a prediction that body size will decrease between fourteen and twenty-four percent by 2050. One study found that for every increase in water temperature by one degree Celsius, the size of fish decreased by twenty to thirty percent. 

Fishes are ectotherms (an animal that cannot regulate their own body temperature); when in warmer waters, their metabolism increases and so they require more oxygen to support their bodily functions. This is one result of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. To think carbon dioxide is absorbed by our oceans and so it is clear that higher emissions contribute to a higher concentration of it in our oceans. Subsequently, as the demand for more oxygen is not available, this leads to fish not getting bigger simply because they cannot support themselves at bigger sizes. One implication of this would be a higher morality rate in smaller species as their size would lead them at a higher risk of predation. 

This does not apply to all fish species however, a study found that smaller-sized fish get smaller, whilst larger fish get larger in warmer waters. It is therefore likely that predatory species will increase with warming, whilst small prey will decrease. Although it is not extensively researched what the consequences of changes in fish body sizes are, it is evident that these alterations will have an impact on the food webs within marine ecosystems.

It has been observed that the diversity of species contributes positively to the stability and functioning of an ecosystem but, due to warming, marine life are changing locations in order to remain in environmental conditions they can tolerate. This leads to the disruption of known interactions between species, necessary for a stable ecosystem, and leads to new interactions being developed. Consequently, the removal of producers or consumers in certain locations will again lead to drastic changes in marine food webs. This is expected to effect entire biological networks in marine ecosystems, from top to bottom and vice versa, and is expected to continue into the the foreseeable future regardless of whether emissions are reduced.

Both consequences to warming will fundamentally alter the biological networks within marine ecosystems. It will also have an impact on fishing; catches will be of less value, with smaller or less or even no fish of a particular species to catch. Furthermore, removing fishes that can adapt to temperature change could reduce species ability to adapt to warming. Therefore, the effects of global warming on marine ecosystems will affect everything, from the composition of fish communities to those who rely on the industry as income and those who need feeding. It is therefore paramount to do something about anthropogenic contribution to warming.  

\section{Data analysis}

Data analysis in fisheries science is critical for the management of fisheries on economic, social, political and, as we have seen, biological grounds. A few examples of the use of fisheries data include: food security; describing the impact of fisheries on economies; identifying exploitation and understanding the effects of climate change. The data is usually collected using standard surveys and is readily available on many websites, notably: the UK's government website or Cefas.

Once the data is collected a thorough exploration of the data will bring its quality to light, which in turn will decide the most useful modelling method to describe or predict hypotheses. In this stage an errors, like outliers, or inconsistencies, like missing values, are identified and corrected. Standard ways to do this involve making box plots, a violin plot or a quantile-quantile plot, for example. R and RStudio are two powerful languages to introduce and aid data exploration, from downloading large sets of data to transforming and visualising it. Two useful guides into this programme and how R can used in fishery science are ‘R for Data Science’ and An Introduction to 'Basic Fisheries Analysis with R’. 

These handbooks also introduce modelling with R, which will be important for interpreting data in order to make appropriate predictions about the effects of warming on marine ecosystems. Modelling is followed after the data is prepped and in this stage a regression is usually implemented. Basic regression models are useful is making predictions only when there is sufficient data and the data is linear. Thus other modelling approaches must be used and are expected to be used in my analysis. Generalised linear models and mixed effect models are a few example of this with the latter being explored later on in this report.

In the studies researched above, the articles all follow a similar structure. They include an abstract, followed by introducing why their research is necessary and relevant. After that they delve into the results of their data analysis and write about what they discovered. Then they discuss what the results mean in the wider context, for example what the possible implications of altering fish body sizes has on food web structures and thus marine ecosystems. At the end of their reports they explain the methods of their data analysis: where the data was found; how it was explored and filtered and then what models were used. In the original article I explored, they used mixed effect models, which is what I then began to research.
